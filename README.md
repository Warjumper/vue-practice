### bug/problem;
- component registered but not used so could not npm run serve
- Google has determined its Eslint
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59821385/component-has-been-registered-but-not-used-vue-no-unused-components
- Component instead of component

- i must disable eslint (the deed is done)
